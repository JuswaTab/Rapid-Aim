# About
This is a simple browser-based "Shoot the Insects" game built using ReactJS. The game challenges players to shoot moving mobs (insects) and increase their score. The game features two modes—Challenge and RegAim—which differ in terms of gameplay mechanics and difficulty.

# Features
Challenge Mode: In this mode, players must aim and shoot moving mobs. Each mob respawns in a random location after being hit, and a blood splash effect appears where the mob was shot. Difficulty scales based on score, with mobs respawning faster as the score increases.

RegAim Mode: In this mode, players must select a difficulty level before starting: Easy, Normal, or Hard. Each difficulty affects the gameplay in the following ways:

    ➤ Easy: Slower mob speed and longer respawn time.
    ➤ Normal: Standard mob speed and respawn rate.
    ➤ Hard: Faster mob speed and shorter respawn time. Increased challenge.

Mob Movement: Mobs (insects) move to random positions within the screen.

Difficulty Scaling: In RegAim, the difficulty level chosen at the start determines the speed and respawn time of the mobs, making the game more challenging as the difficulty increases.

# How to Play
 1. Select RegAim or Challenge-Aim to begin the game.
    ➤ In RegAim, choose a difficulty level: Easy, Normal, or Hard.
 2. Click on the moving mobs (insects) to shoot them and increase your score.

 3. The game gets progressively harder as your score increases, with faster mob respawn rates.

 4. A blood splash will appear each time you hit a mob.
